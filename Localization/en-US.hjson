			GuideHelpText: {
				Ghostwriter: Defeating a powerful foe might attract someone interested in recording your adventures.
				StormCloudfishSummonItem: Tying some bait to a kite would be a good way to attract flying animals.
				StarConstructSummonItem: Combining fallen stars with a suitable metal at a demon altar will allow you to send out signals into the cosmos.
				GigabatSummonItem: Affixing gems to a firefly would be the perfect lure for cave-dwelling bats.
				SaltCave: Salt biomes may look fun to swim in, but the pools of brine within can dry you to a husk in under a minute. Only specialist life can survive there.
				LimestoneCave: Limestone caves are full of unstable stalactites and crumbling rocks, and if that's not enough, they're also crawling with caustic animated gloop.
				StormCloudfish: When you're ready for a fight, attach a worm to a kite made of silk, and let it fly into the upper atmosphere.
				StarConstruct: Using a stellar remote will summon a powerful foe to fight, but fair warning, you may want to ball up some cotton in your ears.
				Gigabat: Sparkly gemflies naturally spend most of their time hidden inside gem trees. Catching one and relocating it could attract attention from underground hunters.
				RiftDenizen: Strange flickers have appeared in the upper atmosphere. I don't know what they are, but they're definitely not of this world.
				FractalDimension: I don't know what lies beyond that rift, but it emanates an aura of chaos hostile to life as we know it. It's likely very inhospitable, particularly for extended periods.
				HallowInvasion: The Hallow may seem aggressive now, but, trust me, it can get worse.
				SunPixie: You should deal with the forces of light sooner rather than later. It may be slow, but their creeping progress risks overwhelming the world given time.
				WorldEvilInvasion: I've heard tales of a second type of evil, sealed away so deep as to be altogether forgotten.
				Esophage: You should deal with the forces of darkness sooner rather than later. It may be slow, but their creeping progress risks overwhelming the world given time.
				ConvectiveWanderer: There is a massive lava ocean in the underworld, filled with unique, molten life. Perhaps you could check it out?
				Eclipxie: That hallowed star you picked up from the Rapture displays interesting properties when exposed to the strange unlight of a solar eclipse.
				Hemorrphage: That fleshy capsid you picked up from the Pestilence displays interesting properties when exposed to the menacing aura of a blood moon.
				Polarities: You've defeated some powerful enemies, and acquired a lot of resources from them, both here, and, apparently, in the fractal world. Combining materials from the two dimensions could yield interesting, if volatile, results.

			StarConstruct: With violently flinging chained hooks and blood-curdling shrieks, this entity blurs the line between organic and automaton.

			Esophage: Empowered with all that is evil, this gargantuan parasite has gained greater autotomy and can survive large durations of time outside of the usual infected, cosmic-sized host.
			Eclipxie: Wish upon a shooting star, and you may just get your wish granted. Wish upon the darkened sun of an Eclipse, and it may just descend from the skies to personally meet you.
			SolMoth: In a desperate attempt for survival, the Eclipxie may sunder itself in two. Searing rays and bright light make up just one half of the Eclipse after all.
			LunaButterfly: In a desperate attempt for survival, the Eclipxie may sunder itself in two. The deep darkness disturbing the peaceful light of day created the Eclipses historical reputation of being a harbinger of doom.
			PlanetPixie: The Eclipxie is never alone. When not splitting itself in two so that it can be its own companion, it may conjure up small, winged flashes of light to keep itself company. Please do not try to use your friends as bullet shields at home.
			//Magneton: A member of the electromagnetic duo, this creature is armed to the teeth with homing rockets, mines, and latent magnetism. It works in perfect tandem with its companion.
			//Electris:A member of the electromagnetic duo, this creature uses its powerful electricity to attack with deathrays, bolts, and deadly auras. It synchronizes its attacks to deadly effect with its companion.
			Zombat: There are bats, there are zombies. Sometimes, there are zombie bats. This feeble creature does its best to perform its batty duties in spite of zombification.
			Rattler: This small, poisonous snake prefers dry climates. It loudly rattles to ward off any predators, but it s just too cute to avoid!
			NestGuardian: Utilizing powerful venom, it bites anyone who approaches. In its dying moments, it unleashes its adorable, but nonetheless harmful offspring onto the world.
			BrineFly: Individually harmless, in large clouds they prove a dizzying nuisance. Some organisms get their entire water intake from eating these flies in large quantities!
			Mussel: Fortified with a hard shell, the Mussel waits for an opportune time to fling pearls to attack! They also have dozens of eyes on the edge of their shells. Just a fun fact.
			Salthopper: A specialized slime with high halotolerance, the Salthopper can rapidly sap any adventurer of bodily moisture.
			AlkaliSpirit: A lesser spirit inhabiting the crumbling Limestone Caves, it's rather fragile and corporeal due to building its body from cave minerals.
			StalagBeetle: A horned beetle specially adapted to the Limestone Caves. It's exceptionally sharp horn and hard shell pierce prey and protect itself from falling rocks respectively.
			StellatedSlime: After having absorbed its own fallen star, it leaps high in the sky to pounce on any unsuspecting bystanders. Performing such leaps is considered a sign of greatness by the slime community.
			BatSlime: Is it a bat, is it a slime? It doesn t matter! It occasionally sprouts wings for greatly enhanced (for slime standards) locomotion.
			BloodBat: Even the bats are riled up from the horrible energy of the Blood Moon! Upon being exposed to its red light, cave dwelling bats become permanently warped.
			Limeshell: Protected by a shell composed of the more durable materials in the caverns, the Limeshell comfortably flings itself at whatever it pleases, with some lasers for good measure.
			Alkalabomination: Empowered by the release of the spirits of light and dark, this ghostly creature is able to accumulate much more alkaline material than before.
			Spitter: With accuracy more comparable to a soldier than any snake, this hooded cobra spits streams of foul venom from afar.
			ConeShell: This unassuming snail packs a deadly secret; a harpoon-like needle it can launch to inject its prey (and unaware swimmers) with its life threatening venom.
			SeaSerpent: An inhabitant of the coral reefs, this aquatic snake packs a brutal venom capable of killing whatever it bites. It's not above sinking its fangs into humans, either.
			Kraken: Powerful tentacles allow this large cephalopod to stand up against creatures of similar size. It can quickly jet towards any prey using its siphon.
			GreatStellatedSlime: Its bigger, its greater, it's... much the same as its smaller counterpart, safe for the rain of falling stars it unleashes at its prey.
			Euryopter: A hovering arthropod-like lifeform, it is reminiscent of long extinct creatures. On close inspection, its claws appear to branch endlessly down in scale...
			FractalFern: Its debatable whether this entity categorizes as an animal or a plant. It s firmly rooted in place, yet spontaneously warps to different locations, and it seems to possess some form of special awareness.
			SparkCrawler: One of the many uncanny creatures inhabiting the Fractal Dimension, this one prefers locomotion by latching onto surrounding strands with its four extendable hooks.
			Amphisbaena: Perhaps the most familiar life form amongst the overwhelmingly alien biosphere of the Fractal Dimension. Double the heads means double the danger however, meaning it offers little comfort to weary adventurers.
			MegaMenger: A mechanical organism seemingly bound to the four cardinal directions. Its surface area appears to be infinite, and within this infinity lies an immense amount of energy. It relentlessly hunts weakened prey with its predictable but fatal methods of locomotion, invariably sapping its victim of all energy.
			Phantobrot: An apex predator of the Fractal Dimension, its overwhelming speed and relentless assault is a good motivator for keeping a low profile in its native habitat.
			FractalPoint: A curious little friend. Direct contact may result in complete obliteration, so tread with caution. Its nature as a fractal entity becomes frighteningly apparent when observing its reproductive capability.
			RavenousCursed: The favorite spawns of the Corruption are no doubt the worms it frequently births. Dreadful fire surges through its body as if it were blood.
			LivingSpine: No biomass goes to waste in the Crimson, even bones belonging to long since decayed bodies are welcomed into the Crimson's collective. As such, even solitary spines dutifully burrow through the blood caked earth, expanding their regions territory.
			TendrilAmalgam: What is seen above ground is but a small piece of an even larger unseen hivemind, linked underground through a complex network of tendrils. It breaches from the soil and rubble to search for unassimilated mass with its many uncoordinated eyes.
			Uraraneid: This creature belongs to a higher caliber than the typical arachnids that dot the Crimson. Using the ichor stored in its large swollen bulb, it can rapidly inflate its legs with the fluid, propelling itself great distances.
			LightEater: If the Eater of Souls truly did consume souls, logically Light Eaters similarly consume light. This would explain their near ineffable hunting strategy of conjuring illusional copies of itself.
			Crimago: Soaring about on fell wings, this living nightmare hunts with its scythe-like claws. Close inspection reveals their claws to be literal bone matter erupting from their flesh... yet the Crimago cares not, the Crimson has long since stolen the sensation of true pain from all of its children.
			//MoltenSpirit: Hotter than hot, this demons origins lie in the worlds core. It is capable of vaporizing flesh in an instant.
			ConvectiveWanderer: This immense magma-dweller can tolerate the extreme temperatures of the Earth's core, using its tentacle-like gills both to drill through solid metal and to protect is more vulnerable head. Highly protective of its much smaller offspring.
			CloudCichlid: These small, fish-like creatures are composed entirely of clouds and swim through the rainy skies as if they were water.
			StormcloudCichlid: Composed of dark, stormy clouds, these fish-like creatures feed on airborne bacteria brought down from the skies in raindrops.
			AmberGemfly: Their luster has become even greater with gemstones affixed to their bodies. That pretty glow in the dark is likely to be spotted by a large predator when underground.
			AmethystGemfly: Their luster has become even greater with gemstones affixed to their bodies. That pretty glow in the dark is likely to be spotted by a large predator when underground.
			TopazGemfly: Their luster has become even greater with gemstones affixed to their bodies. That pretty glow in the dark is likely to be spotted by a large predator when underground.
			DiamondGemfly: Their luster has become even greater with gemstones affixed to their bodies. That pretty glow in the dark is likely to be spotted by a large predator when underground.
			SapphireGemfly: Their luster has become even greater with gemstones affixed to their bodies. That pretty glow in the dark is likely to be spotted by a large predator when underground.
			RubyGemfly: Their luster has become even greater with gemstones affixed to their bodies. That pretty glow in the dark is likely to be spotted by a large predator when underground.
			EmeraldGemfly: Their luster has become even greater with gemstones affixed to their bodies. That pretty glow in the dark is likely to be spotted by a large predator when underground.
			SeaLily: Rooted into the ground, these creatures wave pleasantly in the ocean current. They may not exactly look the part, but they're related to starfish and sea urchins!
			Sunfish: These notably large fish have a bizarre body plan, but pose no threat to adventurers. They're easy pickings for parasites and other aquatic predators, however.
			GraniteCrawler: An unsettling amalgamate of granite energies collecting rocks into a familiar shape, it scurries across the caves at high speed while shielding its vulnerable core-eye from damage.
			Hydra: The legendary beast appears at last! Remove one head, and two more will take its place... or you could simply take out the body supporting them instead.
			FractalSlime: A slime in name only, this fractal ooze ricochets freely around the alien landscape and splits when attacked. Watch out for the perfect corner bounce!
			DustSprite: Animate particulates inhabiting the barren fractal deserts, they attack by swarming targets and overwhelming their senses. May entitle you to financial compensation if inhaled.
			Bisector: Worm-like creatures found deep in the fractal wastes, they tunnel at high speed through the porous caves and cleave prey in two at the atomic level with their infinitely sharp exoskeletons.
			SeaAnomaly: Don't let its surprisingly terrestrial appearance fool you: this fractal creature is as deadly as any other, launching rays of energy to fry unlucky divers.
			TurbulenceSpark: A chaotic well of fractal energy, barely keeping itself stable with the water's pressure. Any disruption will send it careening towards the source, disrupting logical momentum with its alien forces.
			Shockflake: As if dendritic energy wasn't perilous enough, now it's come alive! It haphazardly whirls through the fractal skies, launching electrical bolts to defend its territory.
			Orthoconic: This massive mollusc is the apex predator of the fractal depths, attracted to weakened travellers for easy prey. Look out for its repeating shell!
			ChaosCrawler: The ruler of the fractal wastes' caverns, an alien arthropod that uses its infinite fractal tail to lash and constrict prey. It only targets weakened adventurers, so only fools or worthy challengers may encounter it.
			Painbow: An advanced type of pixie that has learned to separate its light into the colors of the spectrum. It fights with rainbow surges and charges, every shade equally painful.
			Trailblazer: This unique subspecies of pixie leaves a long trail of holy plasma behind itself as it moves, which it happily weaponizes to rope in foes.
			IlluminantScourer: An advanced illuminant slime, blessed with hovering and crystal manipulation abilities. It flies overhead, launching deadly beams of light that are refracted down onto its targets.
			SunKnight: Members of an elite order of hallowed warriors that serve the Empress's rule. They attack with precise leaps and spinning blades to make the sun set on any would-be corrupters.
			SunServitor: Members of an elite order of hallowed mages that serve the Empress's rule. They manipulate the sun's power to bring beams of holy fire crashing down from above, searing sinners where they stand.
			Pegasus: The unicorn's opposite and equal... but still just as angry. The Sun Knights' mount of choice, its magic allows its wings to support its heavy body and soar through the air freely.
			Aequorean: Once a common jellyfish touched by the Hallow's blessing, it swims through air and water with equal grace and launches prismatic reflections of itself to confuse and distract.
			RiftDenizen: This terrifying alien creature emerged from the rift between worlds! It hovers out of reach, opening more portals to launch attacks through; target these to fight back!
			SelfsimilarSentinel: Even the metal in the Fractal Dimension has rudimentary sentience, assembling into this machine-like form to defend itself from assault not of its own kind. A dizzying array of fractal attacks awaits any would-be miners...
			Instability: A localized tear in the space-time continuum, found at the upper edges of the world. Harmless on its own, but who knows what lurks within?
			FrondBud: A juvenile Fractal Frond that has not yet developed any offensive capabilities, its instinctual teleportation nonetheless allows it to avoid predators and reach maturity.
			FractusSpore: When a fractus reaches maturity, it begins to produce these strange hopping creatures, which rove the wastes looking for a spot to lay root and grow. Plant, animal, or something more? Another mystery of the fractals...
			Sparkfly: A surprisingly mundane bug found high in the fractal skies, its abdomen contains a mote of dendritic energy that blinks in strange sequences to communicate. Just don't look too closely...
			Hemorrphage: A much stronger version of Esophage, fought during a blood moon. Because the original wasn't creepy enough, this one comes with more, longer, and spindlier legs.
			Ghostwriter: A friendly specter, she prefers spending her endless freetime reading and writing her very own literature. She's rather sociable, being able to slip through walls opens up many avenues for gossip.
